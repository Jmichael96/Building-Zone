## ABOUT

The experience I had working in the water utility business for 7 years, 
I noticed nearly EVERY single large corporation and city districts with important documents were completely unorganized. 
Blueprints of all the underground water lines were incorrect, and there were no computers with information about how many gallons
were being metered through each district. Contractors (such as myself) were in a difficult bind when we had to locate water lines that
were buried for years, we wasted days destroying property to relocate lines. which in return wasted money, recourses, 
and time that we could have been using to work on a more urgent problem.
